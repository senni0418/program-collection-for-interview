# Introduction
This repo is for me to post program and project collections that I 've done.

In the "programming practice" folder, there will be some programming practice that I think it's interesting or worth to be collected.

The "Project" contains the projects that I had done. The projects are sorted in different languages. There are two sub directories in each, "extra" and "schoolwork". "schoolwork" contains projects done in regular courses and "extra" contains projects done in extracurricular time.
