\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
The goal of this project is to re-implement the classic party game BigTwo with accurate rules and appropriate documentation.The re-implementation of the Game will be for web browsers such that the player can play BigTwo on their own without finding and gathering other players, and also advance their skills in BigTwo.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The clients of this product are the Teaching Assistants and Instructor of the course SE 3XA3. They are responsible for supervising the project, they have a basic understanding of the project and keep track of the project progress through various milestones, and they will be actively involved in the development process of the project.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
The customers for the product are the general public of any ages with knowledge of and physical ability to read and understand English, and basic operation of a computer and web browser, who are interested in the BigTwo card game. Customers of this product are also those users who are interested in advancing their skills in this game.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
    \item General Public and Users - These are the main users intended to use the product after release. They require little or no understanding of the project but should be able to use the product.
    \item Group 6 - As the developers of the game, we hold responsibilities to ensure that this game successfully meets the requirements and goals that are outlined. All members should be involved in various software development phases of this project.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\subsubsection{Product Constraints}
In order to use the product, an internet connection and a web browser are required for the user. Mainstream Web browsers that support JS ES6 and HTML5 are required to run the web application. Users also need to remain connected to the internet throughout the entire game after the web page is loaded.
\subsubsection{User Constraints}
Users and players of the product must have knowledge and physical ability to read and understand English, and basic operation of a computer with mouse/pad and web browser.
\subsubsection{Time Constraints}
The deadline of this project is April 12, 2021. All the development and documentation of this project should be delivered by the deadline, and this limits the amount of features and compromises product quality on the initial release of the software.
\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
There is no budget for this project so all the software and resources used in this project must be free, and this may limits the amount of features and the quality of user experience.
\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item JavaScript - A programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    \item HTML - Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
    \item CSS - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
    \item \textcolor{red}{React.js - An open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. }
    \item Open source - Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution.
    \item User interface - The space where interactions between humans and machines occur.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
We assume that the users and players of the product have the knowledge and physical ability to read and understand English, and basic operation of a computer with mouse and web browser so no extra instruction or resources of these will be provided during the game.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}
The software product for this project is a BigTwo game on major web browsers. The BigTwo game will emulate playing the game of bigtwo with 3 computer bots using standard rules. The BigWwo game being implemented will not have multiplayer functionality and no other game functionality beyond BigTwo.
The goal of this software system is to allow beginners learn about BigTwo, as well as providing a portable platform for players to play BigTwo on their own in this pandemic situation. The objective that this software system aims to achieve is to provide users
with an entertaining and visually pleasing environment to play the game of
BigTwo. The benefits that this software system provides to users is that by playing
BigTwo in an emulation environment without real money, users can practice BigTwo and learn rules faster.

    \item The original project on GitHub was implemented in Java. We will analyze and re-implement the modules in  \textcolor{red}{JavaScript}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsubsection{Existing Products}
There are many existing products for that have created the game of BigTwo. They are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Play Big Two Cards Game Online (http://www.onlinesologames.com/bigtwo)
    \item Big 2 - Card Game - GamsSlush (https://www.gameslush.com/big-2)
    \item Play Big2 online - PlayDOSGame.com (https://www.playdosgames.com/online/big2/)
\end{itemize}
There are many other variations of BigTwo Game found online. We are going to investigate these ready-made products, find the advantages and drawbacks in their designs, and then improve our design and implementation.
\subsubsection{Ready Made Components}

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
N/A
\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
As an open source project the original implementation can be relied upon as a reference.
\subsection{New Problems}
\subsubsection{Problems in Current Environment}
The new game will be running on a website. If the server hosting the website is crashed, then the the game can not run on the website.
\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
This interface stand alone on and does not coexist with an older system.
\subsubsection{Existing Users}
Some potential user problems as an adverse reaction from playing our project are eye soreness and eye strain from extended playing.
\subsubsection{Limitations in implementation environment}
N/A
\subsubsection{Follow Up Problems}
If we one of the developers leave the team, there will be a gap in the information of how the product is implemented. There are also adverse risks if the software becomes too outdated for new upcoming web browsers and technology.
