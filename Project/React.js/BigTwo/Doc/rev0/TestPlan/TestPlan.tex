\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the test plan is to ensure our project BigTwo to be tested systematically and thoroughly. We will build suitable test suites to outline the goals that BigTwo should meet according to the functional requirements and non-functional requirements provided in the SRS.

\subsection{Scope}
The test plan mainly focuses on checking if each functional unit of BigTwo provided functionalities as expected based on the rules of BigTwo. Besides, it also tests if all the non-functional requirements were met.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
BigTwo would be re-implemented for web browsers using Python instead of Java for the existing project. This document specifies what types of tests will be used for testing and gives a detailed description of how the test will be performed. All tests will be built according to SRS and PoC to make sure BigTwo achieves its functionalities.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
The software will allow users to play the BigTwo game on a website with a web browser on the computer. The implementation of the game will be completed in Python and the implementation of the web page will be completed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with modern web technologies.

\subsection{Test Team}
The test team will consist of all Group 6 members who are involved in the development of the BigTwo project. The test team members are Senni Tan, Manyi Cheng, and Jiaxin Tang. The members will test all aspects of the software evenly covering the different types and methods of testing.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
The automated unit testing will be used to check the correctness of the modules such as functions and methods in classes for the game. The functions will be given various inputs to cover normal, boundary, and edge cases. The results of the tested functions will be compared with expected outputs. The results of each unit test case and function must match the requirement specification document for the project to ensure the correctness and robustness of the program.

\subsubsection{Integration Testing}
Integration testing will be used to test the connections between classes and modules to ensure they produce the desired and correct output. This integration testing will require the components to work together to update the state of the game based on various input combinations.

\subsubsection{System Testing}
System testing will be used for testing the entire game system with various user inputs to ensure the application meets all functional and non-functional requirements for the user.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
The PyTest will be used for unit testing for the functions of the modules and the methods of the classes of the game. The JEST framework will be used for unit testing for JavaScript. For the system testing, we will have invited volunteers and ourselves to manually play the game to test it.

\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
Compare with the existing implementation of the web game on \url{http://www.onlinesologames.com/bigtwo}, our project will have similar functionalities with this web game except for the following differences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We will have a main menu section once the web page is loaded, instead of entering the game directly.
    \item In the main menu section, we will have two buttons; "Help" to direct the player to the rules of BigTwo, and "Start the game" for the user to start the game.
\end{itemize}
				
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
This project will incorporate the PyTest framework for unit testing.
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Internal functions of the program will be methods that will have return values or execute a specific task. Unit tests for internal functions will involve having various inputs for the methods and comparing the method output to the expected output. Unit tests will include various inputs for methods consisting of normal inputs, boundary inputs, and inputs that will generate exceptions and errors for the program. The unit tests will display the test cases that have passed, and the test cases that have failed with the traceback to the error. Our goal is to cover as much as possible in order to make sure that we test all functions adequately.
The goal is to achieve 80\% for branch coverage.
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		
This project generates no output files, thus no unit testing will be performed for this section.
